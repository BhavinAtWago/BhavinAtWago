# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Bhavin ‚Äì R&D Automation Engineer at WAGO

## About Me

I specialize in industrial automation, edge computing, and data-driven solutions that make factory systems smarter, more transparent, and easier to manage. My focus is on bridging the worlds of PLCs and modern IT‚Äîdesigning robust architectures for real-time data acquisition, scalable monitoring, and intelligent automation.

Outside of engineering, you‚Äôll find me at the climbing gym, swimming laps, or exploring new tech.
